# Debug-and-Live-Test-App-for-formula-student-car
The app I developed for debug/live-testing for the formula student car on which i am currently working on. 

It is supposed to get data from a serial port that gets data from an NXP board with sensors attatched to it and display it on the debug page in different quardants of the page.

The live-testing part is supposed to show realtime data from the car for in-competition debugging/monitoring of it.
